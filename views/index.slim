        | "It was the first half of 1996 and I was 25 years of age chronologically, six years of age spiritually, and trying to gather enough people to launch Mars Hill Church in the city of Seattle. About ten to 20 people a week were showing up for our Sunday service, which was now being held in one of those especially awful youth rooms."
