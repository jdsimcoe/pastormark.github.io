About ten to 20 people a week were showing up for our Sunday service, which was now being held in one of those especially awful youth rooms."

      h3.gold The Free Building in Ballard No One Wanted
      p
        | Mars Hill Church moves into a small building in Ballard, north of downtown Seattle, and launches its first-ever Sunday morning service.
      p
        | “The long and the short of it is a number of churches were vying to get this free building, even though it was in rough shape. And to help broker the deal—we didn’t have Sunday morning services yet—I put on a suit. I had to go get one, and a tie, and got a King James Bible, and I started rolling over and preaching sometimes on Sunday mornings to all the older, more conservative Christian grandmas, hoping to get them to like this kid with a beard. I grew a beard so I’d look older.
      p
        | It came down to it—us and I think it was a Chinese church—who was going to get this free building? Small building, middle of nowhere, one parking space. Hey, but it’s a home, and we were homeless. And hey, it’s thirty-five minutes away, but it’s a home. And they voted to give it to the other church.
      p
        | And the other church then turned them down because the building was too small, too obscure, middle of nowhere, and needed too much work. And so, yay, we got the free building that nobody else wanted, and that’s when we started our very first Sunday morning services.” - Pastor Mark Driscoll

      p
        | After years of steady growth &amp; bouncing from building to building, Mars Hill Church moves into a renovated warehouse in Ballard.
      p
        | "...We decided, ultimately, we were going to need to consolidate everything and get one big building, and that led to the big Ballard building.
      p
        | It was forty thousand square feet, which was way bigger than we thought we could ever use. At the time, we were a church of eight hundred, thought, 'Well man, we could get one thousand seats into here,' which is way more than we thought we’d ever fill.
      p
        em
          | The bank told us, 'You guys are so young, so poor, so broke, there's no way in the world that you're going to be able to cover this mortgage, so you have to go out and get a tenant to rent from you, somebody that has a stable business history, unlike your church, and that we can guarantee that their revenue will help cover the cost of the mortgage on the building.' " - Pastor Mark Driscoll

          | "So it was going to be Jesus and auto parts. So they did all the drop ceilings. It was configured all in the same way that it is now. I mean, NAPA paid for all that to be developed, and then they pulled out, like, right as we launched." - Pastor Tim Smith

      p
        em
          | "I just remember that right away we needed the space back, and so we were really concerned. Are we going to have to go to NAPA now and say, 'Hey, can we have that space back?' And NAPA's coming to us saying, 'Hey, can we give you the space back? It's not working for us.' " - Pastor AJ Hamilton

      p
        | By God’s grace, NAPA renovated the new Ballard church building, and what was planned to be a NAPA Auto Parts store became the children’s ministry at Mars Hill Ballard. Jesus continued to grow his church, and Mars Hill eventually outgrew the building.

      p
        | Driscoll was unsure of the move to a multi-site model at the time.
        em 
          | “People were talking about video and multi-site, and I thought, “Man, I don’t know. My Shrek-sized head yelling at people for an hour on a screen, who’s going to show up for that?”

      p
        em
          | “God kept bringing more people to hear the gospel. Even five Sunday services [in Ballard] back-to-back didn’t address our need for more space. After so much time and effort to get everyone under one roof, it became clear that this had been a season for maturation, but Mars Hill hadn’t “arrived” as a church with this [Ballard] building. God was only just starting with us.” - Pastor Steve Tompkins

      p
        em
          | “What was crazy is even with a setup, teardown, no offices, no midweek, and video that’s not working, we still grew like crazy. Went to one, two, three services, had to add a night service, outgrew this building, had to go to an entirely new building because God just kept saving people here too, like he had everywhere else.”

      p
        | New locations were launched later in the year in West Seattle and Lake City. The multi-site strategy allowed the people of Mars Hill to grow in numbers and faith while serving in their own communities as local missionaries for Jesus.

      p
        | Mars Hill Church launches The Resurgence as a platform to serve the greater church & train ministry leaders.
